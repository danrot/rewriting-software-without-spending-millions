# Initial Situation

![](diagrams/initial-situation.mmd.svg)

## Problems

- No clear architecture
- Old and nowadays unpopular framework
- Almost no tests
- Almost no static analysis tools
- Duplicated queries and business logic among repositories
- Hard to change database schema
- Some deployments are done manually using `git`
- Code would be written differently today
